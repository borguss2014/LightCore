# LightCore

The beginning of an engine with a light core (sic) & a small game to showcase its capabilities

UPDATE: The engine you're looking for is in another castle!
I've continued development in private on gitlab and significantly changed the structure of the project, being inspired by the Handmade Hero project (no more OOP nonsense, moving away from C++ standard library insanity etc.). Might sync this repo with the up-to-date gitlab repo sometime in the future, when the engine matures a bit.
